      <h1>Welcome to EQUIP!</h1>
      <h3>EQUIP is an equity-focused classroom observation tool, designed to answer three questions:</h3>
      <p>1. Who gets to participate in whole-class discussions?</p>
      <p>2. What is the nature of that participation?</p>
      <p>3. How are different forms of participation distributed across students in the class?</p>

        <h3>Setup your classroom(s)</h3>
        <p>Before an observation, you need to set up the parameters for the classroom you will visit. This includes: (1) who the students are, (2) how the classroom is arranged, and (3) which EQUIP codes (and custom codes) you would like to use for your observation.</p>

        <h3>Perform an observation</h3>
        <p>Take EQUIP into the classroom and make note of participation as it unfolds. EQUIP allows you to track the flow of classroom practice as well as the specific events that take place in a whole class discussion.</p>

        <h3>Visualize your data</h3>
        <p>EQUIP provides built-in analytics so you can receive instantaneous information about the observations youâ€™ve performed. EQUIP also allows you aggregate results from multiple observations, or compare the results of observations.</p>
